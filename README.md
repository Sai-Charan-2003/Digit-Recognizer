# Digit-Recognizer
This notebook is trained to classify the images of the digits that are handwritten using ML techniques.
## MNIST database
MNIST database (stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) consists of large no. of handwritten digit images which can be used to train a model for classifying the digits.
## LeNet- 5
LeNet - 5 is a CNN (Convolutional neural network) architecture which consist of 7 layers on whole (excluding input layer). This notebook is inspired from this architecture. The architecture that this notebook has is similar to LeNet - 5 but not same. The layers used in this notebooks are in this way, [CONV -> AVGPOOL -> CONV -> AVGPOOL -> DENSE -> DENSE -> SOFTMAX].  

***The test accuracy for this model is 98.057%***
